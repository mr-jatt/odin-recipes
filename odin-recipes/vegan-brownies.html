    <h3>Vegan Brownies Recipe</h3>    
    <p>
        These vegan brownies are made with cocoa powder for a rich and gooey chocolaty treat. If you prefer brownies that are a little more solid, you can bake the brownies for longer than the recommended time. Great for people with egg or dairy allergies, too!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour - 2 Cups</li>
        <li>Granulated white sugar - 2 Cups</li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted - 3/4 cups</li>

        <li>Salt - 3/4 tsp</li>
        <li>Hot water or coffee -  1 Cup</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil - 1/2 Cup</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract - 2 tsp</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with baking spray; line bottom with parchment paper.</li>

        <li>Let cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting into 15 squares. Enjoy! </li>
